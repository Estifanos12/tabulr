Absolutely! Here's a clear summary table outlining each feature, what changed, and my recommendation for moving forward:

| **Feature Name**                                       | **What Happened**                                                                                 | **Recommendation**                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Summary Table**                                      | Peer companies removed (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix); some periods now outside time window. | **Keep & Update Later** (table remains useful with updated company set and periods)   |
| **Small Line Chart**                                   | Peer companies removed (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix); chart no longer represents original peers. | **Keep & Update Later** (continue with current companies)     |
| **Constant Value Line (Meta Low)**                     | Analysis period 07/24/2020–07/24/2025 spans outside new chart range.                              | **Keep & Update Later** (can adjust to new date range if needed)  |
| **Constant Value Line (Alphabet Mean)**                | Analysis period 07/24/2020–07/24/2025 spans outside new chart range.                              | **Keep & Update Later** (can adjust to new date range if needed)  |
| **Call-out: Microsoft–Activision Deal**                | Company (Microsoft) removed; date (01/18/2022) is now outside new range.                          | **Delete This Feature** (no longer fits chart scope)    |
| **Call-out: Meta Rebrand**                             | Date (10/28/2021) is outside new date range.                                                      | **Delete This Feature** (outside current period; loses relevance) |
| **Background Shading (2022 Market Downturn)**          | Start date (01/01/2022) now outside new chart range.                                              | **Delete This Feature** (cannot display shading properly)         |
| **Background Shading (Interest Rate Hike Cycle)**      | Start date (03/16/2022) just before new chart range begins.                                       | **Keep & Update Later** (could adjust start to fit range)         |
| **Vertical Line (COVID-19 Market Crash)**              | Date (07/24/2020) is outside current analysis window.                                             | **Delete This Feature** (not relevant to new time frame)          |
| **Vertical Line (Fed Rate Hike Begins)**               | Date (03/16/2022) is just outside new range.                                                      | **Keep & Update Later** (could shift slightly into range if relevant)  |

**Legend:**
- **Keep & Update Later**: Feature still useful or fixable—recommend this for flexible, essential, or easily-adjusted features.
- **Delete This Feature**: Feature is now irrelevant or impossible to display—removal advised for overall clarity and focus.
